        <p>My favourite hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my homework. I am 12 years old and study in class 6<sup>th</sup>.Now I know very well that reading is a very good habit which can make me complete in my thought process.This hobby can be developed by anyone, however I got this naturally. Reading books always keeps one happy and busy. It is a good source of enjoyment , knowledge , inspiration and instruction. It makes us discplined, loyal, punctual, and most importantly a succesful person in our life.</p>
